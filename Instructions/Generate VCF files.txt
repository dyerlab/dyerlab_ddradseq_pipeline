# Upload population map to your barcodes directory using your sftp client.  Instructions on how to create your population map file can be found on the Stacks
# website (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/denovo_map.php).

# Call SNPs using denovo_map.p1 program in stacks.  There is a problem in installing stacks where the path is not properly configured
# for the denovo_map.pl program, before running you need to edit the denovo_map.pl program in a text editor and replace "_BINDIR_" 
# with your stacks file path.  See the example denovo_map.pl file in the pipeline github directory for clarification.
