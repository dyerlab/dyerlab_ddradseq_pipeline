# Create output directory in your data set directory for .vcf file, SNPs in this case.

# Upload population map to your barcodes directory using your sftp client.  Instructions on how to create your population map file can be found on the Stacks
# website (http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/denovo_map.php).

# Pool all your sample libraries from each pooled library into the same directory (/gpfs_fs/hohensteinta/PROW_reads/SNPs/PROW) in this case.
# Label your sample files beforehand so that you know which pooled library they came from.

# Call SNPs using denovo_map.p1 program in stacks.  There is a problem in installing stacks where the path is not properly configured
# for the denovo_map.pl program, before running you need to edit the denovo_map.pl program in a text editor and replace "_BINDIR_" 
# with your stacks file path.  See the example denovo_map.pl file in the pipeline github directory for clarification.
